# Introduction to Quantum Software Programming
*by the Quantum Circuit Simulation Project Team of DOST-ASTI*

Quantum software programming and high-performance computing represent two cutting-edge frontiers in the realm of modern computing. Quantum computing with its promise of exponentially faster processing power and high-performance computing, with its focus on optimizing computational resources for maximum efficiency, are reshaping the landscape of problem-solving and data analysis. In this material, we will explore the basic usage of quantum software and the different models of quantum computation, and basic usage of DOST-ASTI's high performance computer, the Computing and Archiving Research Environment (COARE).
